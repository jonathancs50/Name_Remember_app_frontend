# ReMind

ReMind is a fun web application I designed to help myself remember people that I have met at social events, work functions, and gatherings. Inspired by the historical practice of using index cards for relationship management.
## Background

ReMind was created from a personal challenge that many face: remembering names and details about people we meet. The idea comes from a fascinating historical account of a U.S. president who maintained a system of index cards to track relationships and build meaningful connections. This practice proved invaluable in his journey to the presidency, demonstrating the power of personal relationship management.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
![High Level Architecture](public/high_lvl_view.png)

The system is built using a modern tech stack:
- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Spring Boot
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: AWS Cognito
- Containerization: Docker

### Database Schema
![Database Schema](public/springbootDB.png)

The database design ensures proper data isolation and relationship management between users, events, persons, and index cards.

### Authentication Flow

The application uses AWS Cognito for secure authentication, implementing the OAuth2 authorization code grant flow.

### MVC Architecture Implementation

## Individual Reflection

During the development of ReMind, I gained valuable experience in several areas:

1. AWS Cognito Integration
   - Implemented OAuth2 authentication flow
   - Handled JWT token validation
   - Managed user sessions and security

2. Technical Growth
   - Deepened understanding of Spring Boot
   - Gained experience with Next.js
   - Learned about secure authentication practices

3. Areas for Improvement
   - Enhanced account management features
   - Implementation of search functionality
   - Application deployment

The project provided hands-on experience with modern web technologies while solving a real-world problem. Future iterations would focus on expanding functionality and improving user experience through additional features and optimizations.
